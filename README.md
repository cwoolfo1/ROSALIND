# ROSALIND
This repo contains my solutions to the problems on rosalind.info.
My fall 2020 semester I started to get involved in undergraduate research as a freshman.
Because I lacked the prerequisite knowledge to participate in physics research, I began looking at other research opportunities.
I started working on a bioinformatics project the fall semester of my freshman year that involved bioinformatics and deep learning.
I began completing bioinformatics programming exercises on ROSALIND to help familarize myself with the field of bioinformatics.
